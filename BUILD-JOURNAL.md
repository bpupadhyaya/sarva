# Sarva — Build Journal

One entry per milestone: what was built, what was verified, what's next.

## 2026-07-21 — T0/T1: core engine scaffold

**Built:**
- Monorepo: uv workspace (`core/` = `sarva`, `foundry/` = `sarva_foundry`).
- `sarva.multimodal.content` — the typed multimodal block model (text, thinking,
  image, audio, video, document, tool call/result), frozen + discriminated union,
  with a degradation registry for cross-modality fallback.
- `sarva.providers` — the provider contract (`Provider` protocol, streaming
  `ProviderEvent`s, typed errors), the model registry + router (`models.yaml`
  / `routing.yaml`, data-driven), a deterministic `MockProvider` (offline,
  scriptable — drives the whole test suite with no API key), and a first
  Anthropic adapter (adaptive thinking, streaming, effort).
- `sarva.agent` — the agent loop (explicit state machine, budgets, concurrent
  tool dispatch, confirm-gated destructive tools, append-only JSONL transcript),
  built-in tools (read/write file, shell — sandboxed to the working directory).
- `sarva` CLI (`sarva chat`, `sarva run`, `sarva models`) — zero-config by
  default (falls back to the offline mock model with no API key set).
- 25 conformance tests across content/provider/agent — **all passing**.
- CI (GitHub Actions: lint + format check + test), ruff-clean, ruff-formatted.
- MkDocs skeleton (Part I, Chapter 1) and `examples/01_hello_model.py`.

**Real bugs found and fixed while building (not just theorized):**
- Pydantic's default JSON `bytes` serialization tries UTF-8 decode, which
  breaks on genuine binary image/audio data — fixed with
  `ser_json_bytes/val_json_bytes="base64"` on every content block.
- Rich's `console.print` interprets literal `[`/`]` in dynamic text as markup
  tags and silently drops unrecognized ones — fixed by escaping dynamic CLI
  output and disabling markup parsing for raw model text.

**Known T1 simplifications (documented in code, not hidden):**
- Multimodal degradation isn't wired into the agent loop yet — T1 tools are
  text-only, so this doesn't bite until T2's multimodal I/O pipeline lands.
- Concurrent tool-call events (`tool_started`/`tool_finished`) are yielded in
  two grouped passes rather than true wall-clock interleaving. Tools still
  *execute* concurrently; only event ordering is batched. Tightens in T3
  when a live-progress UI needs it.
- The Anthropic adapter is written to the documented SDK pattern but has
  **not been exercised against a live API key** in this environment — needs
  a real run to fully validate (its conformance tests are mock-only for now).
- `sarva run` with only the mock provider available never calls tools — the
  mock is a dumb echo with no reasoning, so tool-calling only shows up with
  a real model. Expected, not a bug.

**Next:** Ollama local adapter, live-key validation of the Anthropic adapter,
more built-in tools (web fetch/search), then T2 (multimodal I/O pipeline).

## 2026-07-21 — T1 continued: Ollama adapter, web_fetch, graded examples

**Built:**
- `sarva.providers.ollama_provider.OllamaProvider` — talks to a local Ollama
  server's `/api/chat` (NDJSON streaming), tool-call translation, namespaced
  model-id stripping (`ollama/qwen3:8b` -> `qwen3:8b`). CLI now probes
  `localhost:11434` (fast, 0.3s timeout) and routes to it automatically when
  reachable — this is what makes the "free & private" tier real.
- `WebFetchTool` — non-destructive http(s) fetch tool (scheme-validated,
  truncated, error-handled), added to `BUILTIN_TOOLS`.
- `tests/live/` — a new marker tier (`@pytest.mark.live`, skipped by default
  via `-m 'not live'`) holding real-adapter conformance tests for Anthropic
  and Ollama, `skipif`-gated on credentials/reachability so CI stays green
  with zero secrets while still documenting what "done" means for these
  adapters once run against the real thing.
- `tests/conformance/test_tools.py` — file round-trip, path-escape rejection,
  URL-scheme rejection, one live-marked real fetch.
- **Examples 02–05**: tool use, budget-exceeded (clean stop, no hang),
  confirmation-gating (destructive tool denied, loop continues), and a
  real-model web-fetch demo (needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, degrades to a clear
  message without one). Examples 01–04 actually **executed** in this
  environment and produced the expected teaching output; 05 verified to
  fail gracefully with no key.

**Verified, not just written:** full lint (`ruff check` + `format --check`)
clean, 29/29 mock-tier tests passing (3 live tests correctly deselected),
all four offline examples run end-to-end with correct output.

**Known gaps (documented, not hidden):**
- Neither the Anthropic nor the Ollama adapter has been exercised against a
  real endpoint in this sandboxed environment — both are written to their
  documented API shapes and covered by `tests/live/`, but that suite has
  never actually run. Treat both as **unverified until someone runs them
  with real credentials / a real local server.**
- Ollama's `/api/chat` doesn't return token usage — `Usage()` defaults to
  zero for local models; cost tracking for local inference stays $0, which
  is correct, but "tokens used" will read 0 too, which understates true
  context consumption. Revisit if budget-by-tokens matters for local runs.

**Next:** T2 — multimodal I/O pipeline (wire `degrade_message` into the
agent loop; image input end-to-end; first audio path).

## 2026-07-21 — T2 started: image input end-to-end

**Built:**
- `AgentLoop.run()` gained `extra_content: list[ContentBlock] | None` — a
  purely additive parameter (every existing `task: str`-only call site is
  unaffected) that attaches non-text blocks to the initiating user turn.
- A new `_required_modalities()` helper scans the conversation for the
  modalities actually present and the loop now calls
  `router.pick(needs=...)` with it, instead of always assuming text-only.
  A message with an image now correctly routes to a vision-capable model.
- `AnthropicProvider._to_anthropic_message` now encodes `ImageBlock` into
  the real Anthropic API image content-block shape (base64 `source`) — this
  closed a real gap: the content model had `ImageBlock` since T0, but no
  adapter could actually *send* one until now.
- `sarva chat --image path.png "..."` — CLI support for attaching an image,
  with a friendly rejection (`typer.BadParameter`) for non-image files.
- Router-failure hardening: if no available model supports what the
  conversation needs (e.g. an image with only text-only models configured),
  the loop now yields a clean `FAILED` terminal event instead of letting
  `router.pick`'s `LookupError` escape the generator unhandled — a real bug
  that existed since T0/T1 and was only caught while building this feature.

**Verified, not just written:**
- 36/36 tests passing (7 new: modality computation, clean-failure-on-no-model,
  text-only regression guard, image-block base64 round-trip, tool call/result
  translation — all pure/offline, no network).
- **Ran the actual CLI against a real generated PNG** (`sarva chat --image`):
  confirmed the image is correctly routed to `mock` (registered as
  vision-capable) and the run completes `DONE` — the full
  CLI → ContentBlock → loop → `_required_modalities` → `Router.pick` →
  provider pipeline verified working, not just unit-tested in isolation.
- Verified the non-image-file rejection path produces a clean CLI error
  (exit code 2, readable message) rather than a stack trace.
- Fixed a ruff false-positive (B008 on `typer.Option` defaults — required by
  typer's own introspection, not a mutable-default bug) via
  `extend-immutable-calls` rather than suppressing the rule wholesale.

**Known gaps (documented, not hidden):**
- This is *routing* awareness, not full *degradation* — `degrade_message`
  (the recursive video→frames→text style fallback from spec-02) still isn't
  called anywhere. Today: either a model supports what's in the message, or
  the run fails cleanly. Graceful downgrading (e.g. auto-describing an image
  for a text-only model) is real T2 remaining work.
- `ImageBlock` only supports `data`/`path` sources end-to-end — a `url`
  source still raises in `resolve_bytes()` (unimplemented `fetch` module, as
  spec-02 already documented).
- No audio or document (PDF) path yet — image was the first modality wired
  because it's the one with a real vision-capable model already registered.

**Next:** first audio path (transcription-based degradation for text-only
models), or content-level degradation for image→text as the alternative to
routing failure. Then continue toward T3 (server + web UI).

## 2026-07-21 — Session persistence (memory, first slice)

**Built:**
- `sarva.memory.session.SessionStore` — file-based session persistence
  (`~/.sarva/sessions/<name>.json`, one JSON file per session, plain and
  greppable per the design doc's memory philosophy). Session names are
  validated against `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` and **rejected** (not silently
  stripped) if invalid — silent sanitization risked two distinct names
  colliding onto the same file and corrupting history.
- `sarva chat --session <name>` now remembers: loads prior history before
  the run, appends the new user+assistant turn, saves after. Omitting
  `--session` keeps the original one-shot behavior unchanged (no regression).
- `sarva sessions list` / `sarva sessions clear <name>` — inspect and manage
  saved sessions.
- 8 new conformance tests (round trip, binary content survives, missing
  session behavior, name validation, clear/list).

**Verified, not just written:** ran two genuinely separate CLI process
invocations against a scratch `$HOME`, confirmed the second call actually
loaded the first call's history (4 total messages after 2 calls, correct
role/content), confirmed `sessions list`/`clear` operate on the real file.

**Scope, stated plainly:** this is proven correct only for `sarva chat`,
which never uses tools — the full turn is provably exactly `[user message,
final assistant message]`, safe to reconstruct from `RunDoneEvent`.
`sarva run` (which does use tools) is **not** wired for `--session` yet:
reconstructing history across multiple model/tool rounds needs either a
richer return value from the loop or a transcript replay, and building
either without getting the ordering subtly wrong deserved its own slice of
work rather than a rushed add-on here.

**Next:** extend session persistence to `sarva run` (likely via transcript
replay, since every run already writes `transcript.jsonl`), or move to T3
(FastAPI server + web UI) — whichever proves more valuable next iteration.

## 2026-07-21 — T3 started: FastAPI server (REST + WebSocket)

**Built:**
- `sarva.runtime` — extracted the provider/router wiring (Ollama-reachability
  probe, `build_router()`, `build_providers()`) out of `cli.py` into a shared
  module. The server needed the exact same "zero-config, auto-detect
  Ollama" logic as the CLI, and duplicating it would have let the two skins
  drift out of sync on what "available" means — refactored before adding
  the second consumer, not after.
- `sarva.server` — a FastAPI app (`create_app()`) with:
  - `GET /health`, `GET /models` (registry + availability)
  - `POST /chat` — non-streaming, mirrors `sarva chat` exactly (same
    session load/save semantics)
  - `WS /ws/chat` — streams the same `AgentEvent`s the CLI renders, one
    JSON frame per event, ending with `run_done`; single turn per
    connection
- `sarva serve [--host] [--port]` — CLI command, runs the server via
  uvicorn.
- 7 new conformance tests (health, models, chat zero-config, session
  persistence via both REST and WS, WS event streaming) using FastAPI's
  in-process `TestClient` — no real network needed for CI.

**Verified beyond the test suite:** started the actual `sarva serve`
process in the background (real uvicorn, real socket), then hit it with
real `curl` (`/health`, `/models`, `/chat`) and a real `websockets` Python
client against `/ws/chat` — confirmed genuine end-to-end behavior over an
actual TCP connection, not just FastAPI's in-process test transport. Server
process cleanly stopped afterward.

**Known gaps (documented, not hidden):**
- `/ws/chat` is single-turn per connection (matches `sarva chat`'s
  tool-free scope) — no tool-using WS endpoint yet, same limitation as
  `sarva run --session` noted in the previous entry.
- No CORS configuration yet — irrelevant for the CLI-driven smoke tests
  here, but will matter the moment a browser-based web UI (T3's other half)
  tries to call this server from a different origin.
- Picked up a Starlette deprecation warning during testing
  (`httpx`-via-`starlette.testclient` → recommends `httpx2`) — noted, not
  chased; `httpx2` isn't yet an established replacement worth pinning to
  mid-implementation.

**Next:** the web UI (React) that talks to this server, or extend
`/chat`/`/ws/chat` to accept tools (closing the `sarva run` session gap for
both CLI and server at once).

## 2026-07-21 — Closed the tool-use session-persistence gap

**Built:**
- `AgentLoop.run()` gained `transcript_out: list[Message] | None` — purely
  additive (default `None`, every existing call site unaffected). If given,
  it's extended in place with the complete final message list — history
  plus every turn this run appended, including intermediate
  tool-call/tool-result messages — at whatever terminal state the run
  reaches. This is the piece that was missing twice now (flagged in both
  the session-persistence and server-FastAPI journal entries): recovering
  a tool-using run's full history without changing the frozen
  `RunDoneEvent` shape (`final_message` alone only ever carries the *last*
  turn).
- **Found and fixed a real bug while wiring this**, not before: the
  loop only appended the model's message to its own internal `messages`
  list on the `TOOL_USE` path — a plain successful `END_TURN` run never
  added its own final answer to that list. Harmless before now (nothing
  read `messages` from outside), but it would have silently produced
  *wrong* transcripts — missing exactly the final turn — the moment
  anything depended on it. Fixed by moving the append to happen once,
  unconditionally, right after the budget check.
- `sarva chat --session` and `sarva run --session` both switched to
  `transcript_out`, removing the old manual `[history, user, final]`
  reconstruction that only happened to be correct because `chat` never
  used tools. `sarva run --session` **now works for tool-using runs** —
  the gap flagged in the previous two entries is closed.
- The server's `/chat` and `WS /ws/chat` switched to the same pattern for
  consistency (still `tools=[]` — server tool support is a separate,
  bigger decision: confirmation prompts don't have an obvious answer over
  a stateless REST call, and deserves its own design pass, not a rushed
  add-on here).
- 4 new loop tests: full tool-use-round reconstruction, plain-success
  reconstruction (the regression test for the bug above), failure-path
  population, and a not-passed-is-a-no-op guard (16/16 in this file, 55/55
  total).

**Verified, not just written:** the tool-use-round reconstruction is
proven by a dedicated test using a scripted mock (deterministic — no real
model can be made to reliably choose to call a tool, so this is the
correct verification tool for this specific claim). Separately, ran
`sarva run --session` through two real, separate CLI process invocations
and confirmed history persists correctly for the (mock-driven, tool-free)
path the CLI can actually exercise without a live model. Both forms of
verification are honestly reported as what they are — a unit test for the
tool-round mechanics, a live CLI run for the process-level plumbing —
rather than overstating either as covering the other.

**Next:** the web UI (React), or a considered design for server-side tool
confirmation (REST vs. a stateful WS round-trip) before adding tools to
`/chat`/`/ws/chat`.

## 2026-07-21 — T3: the web UI, and `sarva serve` becomes a complete browser experience

**Built:**
- `apps/desktop/` — a real React + TypeScript + Vite app (per the design
  doc's decided stack), hand-written rather than scaffolded from a
  template, kept minimal and readable: a chat UI that opens `/ws/chat`,
  streams `text_delta` events into a live-growing assistant bubble, and
  ends cleanly on `run_done`. Dark-mode aware via `prefers-color-scheme`.
- A small local `events.ts` mirroring `sarva.agent.events.AgentEvent`'s
  JSON shape — scoped deliberately to this app for now rather than
  factored into the design doc's planned `sdks/typescript/` package, since
  it has exactly one consumer today; noted as the natural next home once a
  second one shows up.
- **`sarva serve` now serves the whole thing.** `core/sarva/server/app.py`
  conditionally mounts a built UI at `/` (`StaticFiles`, only if
  `sarva/server/static/` exists — API-only mode still works if it
  doesn't). The static assets are the *committed, built output* of
  `apps/desktop/`, copied into the Python package so `pip install sarva`
  users get a working web UI without needing Node installed. This is a
  **manual step for now** (build, then copy) — a real release pipeline
  (T4/CI territory) should automate rebuilding on every release instead;
  documented as a known limitation, not silently glossed over.
- `.gitignore`: added `node_modules/` and `*.tsbuildinfo`. The generic
  `dist/` rule already inherited from the Python template happens to also
  cover Vite's build output — verified with `git check-ignore`, not
  assumed.

**Verified — real build, real server, real routing, not just code review:**
- Ran `npm install` + `tsc -b` + `vite build` for real: 27 modules
  transformed, zero type errors, a genuine production bundle produced.
- Started the actual `sarva serve` process (again, not the in-process test
  client) and confirmed with `curl`: `/health` and `/models` (explicit API
  routes) are **not shadowed** by the `/` static mount; `/` correctly
  serves the built `index.html`; the exact hashed asset paths Vite
  generated (`/assets/index-*.js`, `/assets/index-*.css`) resolve with
  `200` through the FastAPI mount — proving the asset-linking actually
  works end-to-end through this serving path, not just under Vite's own
  dev server.
- Full test suite still green afterward (55/55) — the static mount didn't
  regress anything.

**Known gaps (documented, not hidden):**
- The chat UI is text-only — no image attach button yet (the CLI's
  `--image` flag has no UI equivalent), and no tool-use rendering (the
  backend doesn't support tools over `/ws/chat` yet either — see the
  previous entry's note on needing a real confirmation-over-WS design).
- No `npm test`/component tests for the React app yet — verified via a
  real build + real server + real HTTP requests this round, which is
  meaningfully better than nothing, but not the same as unit-level
  coverage of the UI's own logic (e.g. the streaming-delta accumulation).
- Static-asset build is a manual, un-automated step (see above) — a stale
  `sarva/server/static/` after a UI source change is a real risk until a
  CI job (or at minimum a `Makefile`/script) rebuilds and re-copies it
  automatically.

**Closed within this same entry:** added `scripts/build-web.sh` (build +
copy in one command, actually run and verified to reproduce the identical
build) — the "manual step" risk above is now "run one script before
committing" rather than "remember several commands in the right order."
Still not CI-automated, but meaningfully lower-risk.

**Next:** UI component tests, or the tool-confirmation-over-WS design
needed before tool-using conversations can reach the browser.

## 2026-07-21 — UI component tests + CI now covers the web app

**Built:**
- Vitest + React Testing Library wired into `apps/desktop/` (`npm run
  test`). 7 tests covering `App.tsx`'s own logic: empty state, WebSocket
  URL/payload on send, streaming-delta accumulation into the assistant
  bubble, clean success, failure-state error display, composer
  disabled-while-streaming, and connection-error handling. A small mock
  `WebSocket` class drives these deterministically — real WebSocket
  delivery is already proven end-to-end (previous entry: a real
  `sarva serve` process hit with a real `websockets` client), so this mock
  exists to test the UI's *reaction* to events, not to re-prove transport.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) gained a second job, `web`: npm install,
  typecheck, test, build — the frontend was completely unverified in CI
  until now. Also fixed a real gap in the existing Python job: `examples/`
  was linted locally every milestone but never actually in CI's lint
  command — added it.
- **A CI check with teeth for the exact risk flagged last entry:** after
  building, CI now diffs the fresh `dist/` against the committed
  `core/sarva/server/static/` and fails with a clear message if they
  differ — turning "a human might forget to run `scripts/build-web.sh`
  before committing" from a documented risk into something CI actually
  catches.

**Real bugs found while writing these tests, not before:**
- Testing Library's DOM auto-cleanup between tests silently doesn't
  register without Vitest's `globals: true` (which this project
  deliberately doesn't use, preferring explicit imports) — every test
  after the first was finding duplicate elements from prior tests' unmounted
  DOM. Fixed with an explicit `afterEach(cleanup)` in `setupTests.ts`.
- Manually invoking the mock WebSocket's `onmessage`/`onopen`/`onerror`
  callbacks from test code doesn't reliably flush the resulting React state
  update before the next assertion runs — these calls aren't recognized as
  React-managed events the way `fireEvent` is. Fixed by wrapping each
  simulated callback in `act()`.

**Verified the CI check isn't just decorative:** actually broke the static
bundle on purpose (changed visible UI text, rebuilt, diffed) and confirmed
the check catches it with a clear failure message, then reverted and
confirmed it passes clean again — the same discipline applied to every
claim of "this works" all week, now applied to a CI check about CI checks.

**Next:** the tool-confirmation-over-WS design needed before tool-using
conversations can reach the browser, or continue toward T4 (Tauri desktop
wrapper).

## 2026-07-21 — Tool confirmation over WebSocket: the browser can now act, safely

**Built:**
- `/ws/chat` now runs with `BUILTIN_TOOLS` enabled (mirrors `sarva run`,
  not `sarva chat` — documented explicitly, since `/chat` stays tool-free:
  a stateless REST request can't naturally pause mid-request for a
  confirmation round-trip, which is exactly why this lives on the
  WebSocket). Client sends `{"message", "session", "auto"}`; a destructive
  tool call pauses the run and sends `needs_confirmation`, then the
  *next* value the client sends — `{"approved": bool}` — is consumed as
  the answer before the loop continues. `"auto": true` mirrors
  `sarva run --auto`.
- **A real protocol subtlety, found and documented, not glossed over:**
  `needs_confirmation` is emitted by the loop whenever a destructive call
  happens *at all* — it is not suppressed by `auto`. What changes is the
  confirm *policy* (`always_allow`, which never reads from the socket). A
  client in auto mode must treat the event as informational only and must
  NOT reply to it — there's nothing waiting to consume a reply, and
  sending one risks it being misread as the answer to a later, real
  prompt. Documented in the handler's docstring for whoever builds the
  next client.
- **The web UI now has real confirmation UI**, not just backend plumbing:
  an Approve/Deny card renders on `needs_confirmation` and blocks further
  input until answered; `tool_started`/`tool_finished` render as inline
  status lines in the assistant bubble.
- 3 new server tests (approve runs the tool, deny skips it, auto never
  blocks waiting for a reply) + 4 new UI tests (confirmation card renders
  and responds correctly, tool status lines render, card clears on
  run_done even if never answered) — 58 Python + 11 web tests, all
  passing.

**A real bug in my own first test, caught by actually running it:** my
first "auto mode" test asserted `needs_confirmation` would never be sent
at all — wrong assumption about the wire protocol, not a code bug. Writing
a test that failed for the *right* reason (a false assumption, not a
missed edge case) led directly to documenting the actual, correct
behavior above instead of shipping an incorrect mental model into the
docstring.

**Verified beyond the test suite (again, real process not just TestClient):**
started the actual `sarva serve`, confirmed `/health`, `/models`, and a
real WebSocket connection with `BUILTIN_TOOLS` wired in all still work
over an actual TCP socket (the mock provider can't self-initiate tool
calls to prove the confirmation round-trip this way — that's what the
scripted-provider pytest tests are for, and they exercise the identical
server code path via ASGI transport, not a mock of it).

**Next:** T4 — the Tauri desktop wrapper (the one-click app for
non-developers), or extending `/chat` (REST) with a "define outcome"
style async pattern if tool use is ever needed there too.

## 2026-07-21 — T4 started: Tauri desktop wrapper (step 1 of 2)

**Scope decision, stated up front:** the design doc's north-star is
"double-click an icon, no terminal" for non-developers. Fully delivering
that needs a Python runtime bundled *inside* the app (a Tauri sidecar) so
the app can start its own backend — real, separate work (cross-platform
Python packaging, code-signing, sidecar process management). Rather than
half-build that under time pressure, this entry ships **step 1 only**: a
real native window that loads the existing web UI from a `sarva serve`
backend the user starts themselves. Honestly, this is *not yet* one-click
for non-developers — it's a native shell around what already works,
with the remaining gap named precisely (not implied away) so nobody
mistakes "it runs" for "it's done."

**Built:**
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/` — Tauri 2 (Rust) scaffold via `tauri init`,
  then hand-cleaned: package/lib renamed from generic `app`/`app_lib` to
  `sarva-desktop`/`sarva_desktop_lib`, a real identifier
  (`io.github.bpupadhyaya.sarva`, not the generated placeholder), removed
  `beforeDevCommand`/`beforeBuildCommand` (pointless here since
  `frontendDist`/`devUrl` point directly at the FastAPI server, not a
  locally-built or served asset — Tauri isn't serving anything itself in
  this architecture, just displaying it).
- `lib.rs` carries an explicit doc comment stating the step-1/step-2 split
  above, so the gap is visible in the code itself, not just this journal.
- CI gained a `desktop` job: `cargo check --locked` on every push (fast
  compile/borrow-check regression coverage). Deliberately **not** a full
  release build or cross-platform bundle — that's real infrastructure
  (multi-OS runners, code signing, `.dmg`/`.msi`/`.AppImage` artifacts)
  that belongs in step 2's own entry, not bolted on here to make this one
  look more finished than it is.

**Verified — this is the part that matters most for a desktop app:**
not just `cargo check`. Ran a real `tauri build --no-bundle`, producing an
actual 8.3MB arm64 Mach-O executable. Started a real `sarva serve` backend
and then **launched the built binary as a real OS process** — confirmed
it spawned genuine WebKit XPC helper processes (WebContent, GPU,
Networking — exactly what happens when a native macOS app creates a real
`WKWebView`), and confirmed in the backend's own access log that the
webview actually requested and received `GET /`, the JS bundle, and the
CSS bundle, all `200 OK`. That's the complete load pipeline, verified
through a genuine native app process — not a browser, not a test client.

**A real environment hiccup, handled correctly rather than worked around
carelessly:** port 8000 (the default) was already occupied by an
unrelated, pre-existing process in this environment (not something this
session started). Rather than kill an unknown process I don't own, the
verification above used a separately-confirmed-free port for the test,
then restored the committed config to the correct, standard default
(8000) afterward — the shipped config is correct; only the *verification
run* used a different port to get a clean result.

**Known gaps (the honest heart of this entry):**
- No bundled Python backend — the biggest remaining piece of the
  one-click promise. Tracked explicitly, not glossed over.
- Icons are Tauri's generated placeholders, not real Sarva branding.
- No code signing / notarization — an unsigned build will trigger
  Gatekeper warnings on macOS and SmartScreen warnings on Windows.
- CI checks compile correctness only, not that a real bundle builds on
  every platform.

**Next:** the Python sidecar (step 2 — the actual one-click unlock), or
real branding/icons, or cross-platform bundle CI. Sidecar is the one that
actually completes the mission's stated promise, so it's the natural next
priority when picked up.

## 2026-07-21 — T4 step 2: Python sidecar — the one-click unlock

The gap named at the end of step 1: bundle the Python backend itself so
launching the desktop app is the entire install, no terminal, no manual
`sarva serve`. This entry closes it.

**Built:**
- `scripts/freeze-server.sh` — PyInstaller `--onefile` freeze of the
  `sarva` CLI into a standalone executable, named per Tauri's sidecar
  convention (`sarva-server-<rust-target-triple>`) and dropped into
  `apps/desktop/src-tauri/bin/` (gitignored — a rebuilt-on-demand native
  binary, not source, so it isn't committed, unlike `core/sarva/server/static/`
  which is committed because it lets the app run with zero Node at
  install time; a frozen native binary has no equivalent "just works from
  source" fallback, so committing it would only bloat the repo with
  something CI/release should produce instead).
- Two `--add-data` flags bundle the non-Python files the backend reads at
  runtime — `core/sarva/providers/data/*.yaml` (the model registry) and
  `core/sarva/server/static/` (the web UI) — into the frozen archive at
  the same relative path `Path(__file__).parent / ...` already expects.
  PyInstaller's import analysis only follows Python imports; it does not
  discover data files a module reads at runtime, so without this the
  frozen binary starts but 500s on first real request.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — added `tauri-plugin-shell`.
  `tauri.conf.json` — declared `bundle.externalBin: ["bin/sarva-server"]`.
  `capabilities/default.json` — scoped `shell:allow-execute` permission to
  exactly the `sarva-server` sidecar with a fixed `serve` arg (not a
  general shell-exec grant).
- `lib.rs` — `run()` now spawns the sidecar in `setup()`, logs its
  stdout/stderr through the app's own logger (so a startup failure is
  visible, not silently eaten), and kills it on the window's
  `CloseRequested` event.

**Real bug found and fixed while building (not just theorized):** the
first frozen-binary test (`--help` only) looked clean, but a full `serve`
run 500'd on `/models` and `/chat` with
`FileNotFoundError: .../_MEI.../sarva/providers/data/models.yaml` — exactly
the data-file risk named as a known unknown in the prior planning. Fixed
with the `--add-data` flags above; re-verified `/health`, `/models`, `/`,
and a real `/chat` round-trip all succeed from the frozen binary alone.

**Verified — the actual one-click path, not just the freeze:** ran a real
`tauri build --no-bundle`, then launched the resulting
`sarva-desktop` binary as a standalone OS process with **no `sarva serve`
running and no source repo on the loader's `sys.path`**. Confirmed via
`pgrep` that the app itself spawned `sarva-server serve` as a child
process, and confirmed over HTTP that `/health`, `/models`, and `/chat`
(a real mock completion) all responded correctly through it — the
complete one-click path, from double-click to a working chat response,
with zero manual steps.

**A real gap found, not papered over:** killing the app process directly
with `kill` (SIGTERM) — as opposed to closing its window — does **not**
run the `CloseRequested` handler, so the sidecar is orphaned and keeps
running. This was caught by testing the shutdown path explicitly (`kill
$APP_PID` then `pgrep sarva-server`), not assumed to work because the
happy path did. This matches the standard, documented caveat for Tauri's
sidecar pattern generally (window-close events don't fire on external
signals to any GUI app, not a bug specific to this code) — normal users
quitting via the window or Cmd+Q are unaffected, but a force-quit,
`pkill`, or crash leaves an orphaned backend process. Not fixed in this
entry; tracked as a known gap rather than silently shipped.

**Known gaps:**
- Orphaned sidecar on ungraceful app termination (above) — a real fix
  needs OS-level process-group or signal-handler work, not a quick patch.
- Still no code signing/notarization on the sidecar binary itself, in
  addition to the app bundle gap noted in step 1.
- `freeze-server.sh` and the sidecar wiring are verified on macOS
  arm64 only; Linux/Windows freezing and the `.exe` sidecar suffix
  convention are untested.
- The `desktop` CI job still only runs `cargo check` — it doesn't freeze
  the Python backend or build a real bundle, so this entire path has no
  CI coverage yet. A real release pipeline needs a job that runs
  `freeze-server.sh` before `tauri build`.

**Next:** fix the orphaned-sidecar gap (likely a `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`
handler on the main process that also kills the sidecar), then real
branding/icons, then cross-platform release-bundle CI covering the full
freeze → bundle → sign pipeline on all three OSes.

## 2026-07-21 — T4 step 2 follow-up: fix the orphaned sidecar

Closed the gap named at the end of the previous entry, and found a
second, deeper bug while verifying the fix.

**Built:**
- `#[cfg(unix)]` `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` handler (`signal-hook`, a dedicated
  OS thread blocking on `Signals::forever()`) that kills the sidecar and
  exits before the process dies from the signal. Covers force-quit,
  `pkill`, and `kill` — not just the graceful window-close path.

**Real bug found while verifying the fix (not just theorized):** after
wiring the signal handler, `kill $APP_PID` still left a `sarva-server`
process holding the port. Root cause, confirmed with
`ps -o pid,ppid,pgid`: PyInstaller's `--onefile` bootloader — the process
Tauri actually spawns and tracks as the sidecar `CommandChild` — forks a
**second** process to run the real frozen app and waits on it.
`child.kill()` only ever reaped the bootloader; the grandchild (the
actual running `uvicorn` server) was untouched and kept the port bound.
This affected **both** shutdown paths equally (window-close and the new
signal handler use the same `child.kill()` call) — it was latent in the
sidecar work shipped in the previous entry, not introduced by this one;
it only surfaced now because this entry specifically tested the
shutdown path end-to-end instead of assuming it worked. Fixed with a
`kill_sidecar()` helper that `pgrep -P`s the sidecar's own children and
kills them before killing the sidecar itself, called from both shutdown
paths.

**A red herring, run down and ruled out rather than assumed:** midway
through this fix, the sidecar appeared to stop binding its port at all,
even with the fix reverted — looked like a real regression. Root-caused
by polling with a fixed sleep instead of retrying: PyInstaller
`--onefile` re-extracts its payload to a temp directory on *every*
launch (no cache across runs), and under the machine's load at the time
(load average ~4.1) that extraction occasionally took longer than the
few seconds the earlier tests happened to wait. Confirmed by polling
with a longer timeout, which showed the exact same binary succeeding
consistently once given enough time. No code change was needed for this
part — worth recording so a future session doesn't chase the same ghost.

**Verified:** rebuilt, waited for the sidecar to bind (polling, not a
fixed sleep, after the above), confirmed `/health` responds, captured the
full process tree (bootloader + grandchild), sent `kill` to the app
process, and confirmed via `pgrep` that **no** `sarva-server` process
survives — the fix closes the gap for both the direct child and the
grandchild.

**Known gaps carried forward:**
- Windows has no equivalent signal handling yet (untested platform).
- `kill_sidecar` shells out to `pgrep`/`kill` rather than using a Rust
  process-group API — pragmatic given `tauri-plugin-shell` doesn't expose
  the underlying `std::process::Command` needed to set up a real process
  group at spawn time, but worth revisiting if that changes.
- Still no CI coverage for the freeze → sidecar → shutdown path.

**Next:** real branding/icons, then cross-platform release-bundle CI
covering the full freeze → bundle → sign pipeline on all three OSes.

## 2026-07-21 — F0: foundry track starts — a from-scratch BPE tokenizer

Every prior entry was `core/sarva`, the engine that leans on frontier
models. This one starts the other half of the mission — §3.6 of the
design of record, "no black boxes": Sarva must also carry the model-level
code, not just orchestrate someone else's model. First component: a
trainable byte-level BPE tokenizer, no HuggingFace `tokenizers`, no
`tiktoken`.

**Built:**
- `foundry/sarva_foundry/tokenizer/bpe.py` — `ByteLevelBPETokenizer`,
  implemented from first principles: a reversible byte↔Unicode-symbol
  mapping (the same trick GPT-2 uses) gives every possible byte value a
  dedicated vocabulary entry, so encoding never produces `<unk>` — any
  text, including scripts/emoji never seen during training, round-trips
  losslessly. A stdlib-`re`-only pretokenizer approximates GPT-2's regex
  (documented in the module docstring exactly where it diverges, rather
  than claimed identical). Training repeatedly merges the most frequent
  adjacent symbol pair until the requested vocab size is reached; encoding
  replays those merges in learned order. Special tokens (e.g.
  `<|endoftext|>`) are reserved ids, matched atomically before byte-level
  splitting. JSON save/load for trained tokenizers.
- `tests/foundry/test_tokenizer.py` — 10 conformance tests: round-trip on
  ASCII and on unseen Unicode/emoji, empty-input edge case, vocab-size
  budget respected, invalid vocab size rejected, merges actually compress
  a training sentence, training is deterministic (same corpus → identical
  merges/vocab), special tokens stay atomic and round-trip, save/load
  round-trip. All passing.
- `examples/02_train_a_tokenizer.py` — trains on a four-sentence toy
  corpus and prints both the compression (`"the quick brown fox"`: 19
  byte-level tokens → 4 trained tokens) and a round-trip proof on
  `"héllo wörld —日本語 🎉🚀"`, text the tokenizer never saw.
- `docs/foundry/tokenizer.md` — the matching docs chapter (design
  principle: every module gets one), covering why byte-level, how
  training works, and how to run the example. Wired into `mkdocs.yml`'s
  nav (validated the YAML parses correctly; `mkdocs` itself isn't a
  project dependency yet, so the actual site build is still unverified —
  named honestly rather than assumed to work).

**Real bug found and fixed while building (not just theorized):** the
first draft of the merge step rebuilt the word-frequency table with a
dict comprehension (`{merge(word): freq for word, freq in ...}`), which
silently drops frequency mass whenever two distinct pre-merge words
collide into the same tuple after a merge — the last one wins, the rest
vanish, and training silently learns a slightly wrong distribution with
no error or test failure to catch it. Fixed by accumulating into a
`Counter` with `+=` before any test ran against it, so it never shipped.

**Known gaps:**
- Tokenizer only — no model architecture, pretraining loop, or anything
  else from §3.6 yet. This is the first component of a large track.
- `mkdocs` isn't installed/pinned as a project dependency, so the docs
  site itself has never actually been built, only the YAML validated.
- No data-pipeline code yet — training above used an inline toy corpus,
  not the corpus-sourcing/cleaning/dedup pipeline §3.6(c) describes.

**Next:** the from-scratch transformer architecture (attention, RoPE,
RMSNorm, SwiGLU, GQA — the teaching-baseline dense decoder from §3.6a),
or continue rounding out desktop (branding, release CI). Foundry is the
harder, more novel work and was the natural next pick this iteration;
either track can lead next.

## 2026-07-21 — F0 continued: the from-scratch transformer

The teaching-baseline dense decoder from §3.6a: attention, RoPE, RMSNorm,
SwiGLU, GQA — the architecture every current LLaMA/Qwen/Mistral-class
model is a variation of, implemented directly from the math rather than
imported from `transformers`.

**Built:**
- `foundry/sarva_foundry/model/layers.py` — `RMSNorm` (root-mean-square
  norm, float32-upcast for stability); `precompute_rope`/`apply_rope`
  (rotary position embeddings, rotate-half convention); `SwiGLU` (gated
  feedforward) with `default_swiglu_hidden_dim` matching LLaMA's
  parameter-matched sizing convention.
- `foundry/sarva_foundry/model/attention.py` — `GroupedQueryAttention`:
  query heads split into groups sharing one KV head each (`repeat_kv`
  expands the shared KV heads to match), RoPE applied to q/k before
  attention, causal masking enforced unconditionally — no non-causal mode
  exists to accidentally select. The module docstring states explicitly
  where "from scratch" stops: `nn.Linear`/`nn.Embedding` and PyTorch's
  fused `scaled_dot_product_attention` kernel are commodity substrate
  (same tier as `torch.matmul`), not model logic.
- `foundry/sarva_foundry/model/transformer.py` — `TransformerBlock`
  (pre-norm residual composition) and `DecoderOnlyTransformer` (tied
  embedding/unembedding, token ids in → logits out).
- `tests/foundry/test_model.py` — 13 conformance tests, two of which are
  the actual point of this entry: `test_rope_encodes_relative_not_absolute_position`
  verifies RoPE's defining mathematical property directly (rotated q·k
  depends only on relative offset) rather than trusting a correct-looking
  implementation, and `test_causal_masking_prevents_attending_to_future_tokens`
  perturbs only the last token in a sequence and asserts every earlier
  position's output is bit-for-bit unchanged — the only test that can
  actually catch causal masking silently not masking, since a broken
  causal flag still produces plausible, right-shaped logits. Also: a
  full end-to-end trainability test (loss decreases over 50 optimizer
  steps on a toy task) that exercises gradient flow through every layer
  at once.
- `examples/03_train_toy_transformer.py` — wires the tokenizer (previous
  entry) into the transformer: trains on real token ids, 200 CPU steps,
  greedy-decodes a continuation.
- `docs/foundry/transformer.md` — the matching docs chapter, including
  both bugs below as worked examples of why shape-correct isn't the same
  as correct.

**Two real bugs found and fixed while building (not just theorized):**
1. The tokenizer's merge step (carried over from the previous entry) was
   already fixed; this entry's own bug: `precompute_rope`'s cos/sin
   tables are finite (bounded by `max_seq_len`), and `GroupedQueryAttention.forward`
   sliced them with no bounds check. Found by actually running the
   generation loop in example 03 — not by any unit test, since every test
   used a fixed sequence length — which grows the sequence past
   `max_seq_len` one token at a time. Slicing past a tensor's length
   doesn't raise in Python, it just returns something shorter, so the
   real failure surfaced several calls later as a confusing
   shape-mismatch deep inside `apply_rope` instead of at the actual
   misconfiguration. Fixed with an explicit, immediate bounds check at
   the top of `forward()`, and pinned with
   `test_forward_raises_a_clear_error_past_max_seq_len`.

**Known gaps:**
- Teaching baseline only — no MoE routing, long-context scaling, or
  native multimodal input yet (§3.6a's "frontier-class" extensions).
- No pretraining data pipeline (§3.6c) — training so far uses inline toy
  corpora, not real corpus sourcing/cleaning/dedup.
- No checkpointing/resume or distributed training (§3.6d) — everything
  verified so far is single-process CPU, seconds-scale.

**Next:** either the pretraining data pipeline + a real (checkpointed)
training loop, or continue rounding out desktop (branding, release CI).

## 2026-07-21 — F0 continued: dataset chunking + checkpoint/resume training loop

The last piece needed before the foundry track has a genuinely runnable
(if toy-scale) pretraining pipeline: corpus → batches (§3.6c, the
chunking mechanism) and a training loop that can actually survive being
interrupted (§3.6d).

**Built:**
- `foundry/sarva_foundry/data/dataset.py` — `tokenize_corpus` (encodes a
  corpus and concatenates it with `<|endoftext|>` document separators, so
  the model learns document boundaries instead of treating unrelated
  documents as one continuous stream) and `TextChunkDataset` (fixed-length
  `(input, target)` chunks, target shifted right by one — standard
  next-token-prediction framing; the trailing leftover tokens that don't
  fill a whole chunk are dropped, not padded, and that behavior is
  tested, not just assumed).
- `foundry/sarva_foundry/train/trainer.py` — `Trainer`: a training step,
  gradient clipping, and `save_checkpoint`/`load_checkpoint` that persist
  **optimizer state** (AdamW's per-parameter momentum/variance), not just
  model weights — the module docstring states directly why this matters:
  a checkpoint that only restores weights silently restarts momentum
  from zero, training differently from the run it claims to resume, with
  no exception to catch the difference.
- `tests/foundry/test_dataset.py` (6 tests) and `tests/foundry/test_trainer.py`
  (3 tests) — the trainer tests are the ones that matter most here:
  `test_checkpoint_resume_is_bit_identical_to_uninterrupted_training`
  proves resume actually resumes (10 uninterrupted steps vs. 5 steps →
  checkpoint → fresh `Trainer` loaded from disk → 5 more steps produce
  identical final weights), paired with a **negative control**,
  `test_checkpoint_without_optimizer_state_would_diverge`, that
  deliberately reintroduces the bug the module warns about (swaps in a
  fresh optimizer post-load) and asserts the result *does* diverge —
  without this control, the positive test wouldn't prove much, since the
  toy task could coincidentally converge to the same point regardless of
  optimizer state.
- `examples/04_pretrain_and_resume.py` — the full pipeline built across
  three entries, run together: tokenizer → dataset → transformer →
  trainer, 30 steps, checkpoint, a *fresh* model/trainer resuming for 30
  more steps. Loss descends smoothly across the checkpoint boundary
  instead of spiking — the visible proof, not just the test's numeric
  assertion.
- `docs/foundry/training.md` — the matching docs chapter, including the
  positive/negative test pairing as a worked example of why a passing
  checkpoint test alone doesn't prove correctness.

**A real bug introduced and caught by this entry's own verification
step, not shipped:** fixing a `ruff` B008 lint warning (mutable/call
default argument — `TrainerConfig()` as a literal default value) by
switching to `config: TrainerConfig | None = None` left the constructor
body still reading the old parameter name (`config.lr`) instead of
`self.config.lr`, which is `None` post-refactor — an `AttributeError` on
every `Trainer()` call. The lint fix looked complete (ruff was clean,
the diff looked like a mechanical rename); the bug was invisible to
`ruff check` and would have been invisible to a review that didn't
re-run the tests after the "trivial" fix. Caught immediately because
this session runs the full test suite after every change without
exception, not just after the change that looks risky.

**Known gaps:**
- No real corpus sourcing (web/code/books/math crawling, cleaning,
  dedup, quality filtering) — `tokenize_corpus` is the chunking mechanism
  §3.6c needs, not the sourcing pipeline.
- No distributed training (FSDP/3D parallelism) or loss-spike handling —
  everything verified is single-process CPU, seconds-scale.
- No learning-rate schedule (warmup/decay) — `Trainer` uses a flat LR.

**Next:** real branding/icons + cross-platform release CI for the
desktop app (still open from T4), or scaling the foundry pipeline up
from toy-corpus to a real small dataset with an actual LR schedule.

## 2026-07-22 — CI: cross-platform matrix, and a real CI-only regression found and fixed

Extended the `desktop` job to a `[macos-latest, ubuntu-latest,
windows-latest]` matrix — the T4 sidecar work had only ever been verified
on macOS arm64, and a `cargo check`-level regression on Linux/Windows had
no way to surface before this. This entry also caught and fixed a real
bug that had been silently breaking CI for two prior commits.

**Built:**
- CI matrix for the `desktop` job across all three target OSes, with
  Tauri's documented Linux system-package prerequisites
  (webkit2gtk/appindicator/etc.) installed on `ubuntu-latest` first.

**A real bug found immediately after pushing — by actually watching CI,
not by assuming a green local run meant CI was fine too:** `gh run list`
showed the *previous two* commits' CI runs had failed on the `desktop`
job — going back to the T4 step-2 sidecar commit. Root cause:
`tauri-build`'s build script validates that every `bundle.externalBin`
path exists on disk, and fails the **entire compile** — `cargo check`
included, not just a real `tauri build` — if it doesn't. The sidecar
binary (`scripts/freeze-server.sh`'s output) is correctly gitignored as a
large, per-platform artifact this repo deliberately doesn't commit, which
means CI has never had one on disk since `bundle.externalBin` was added,
and the `desktop` job has been failing on every single push since —
invisible because nothing in this session's workflow had checked `gh run
list` after those two prior pushes, only local `cargo check`, which
always had the real binary present locally.

**Fixed** with a CI step that creates an empty placeholder file at the
exact target-triple path Tauri's build script checks for
(`bin/sarva-server-<target-triple>[.exe]`, computed via `rustc -vV`),
before `cargo check` runs. This is proportionate to what the job actually
checks (compile correctness, per its own existing comment — never meant
to verify the sidecar itself, which is verified locally and recorded
earlier in this journal) rather than trying to run a full PyInstaller
freeze inside a job whose entire value proposition is being fast and
cheap. Verified the fix two ways before trusting it: (1) reproduced the
exact failure locally by moving the real sidecar binary aside and
re-running `cargo check`, confirming the identical `resource path ...
doesn't exist` error; (2) applied the same placeholder-file logic
locally, confirmed `cargo check` then passed, restored the real binary,
confirmed it *still* passed. Only then pushed, and watched the real CI
run (`gh run watch`) to completion — genuinely green across `core`,
`web`, and all three `desktop` OS variants, not inferred from the fix
"looking right."

**The lesson, stated plainly because it's worth remembering beyond this
one bug:** this session's discipline of running local tests/lint before
every commit is necessary but was not sufficient — it caught every
Python-side regression this session but had no way to catch a
CI-environment-specific failure (missing file on a fresh checkout) that
only manifests where the working tree doesn't already have local,
gitignored build artifacts sitting around. `gh run list`/`gh run watch`
after a push that touches CI-relevant files (or any push, periodically)
is now part of how this loop verifies "pushed" actually means "working,"
not just "compiled locally."

**Known gaps:**
- Still no real cross-platform **bundle** CI (`.dmg`/`.msi`/`.AppImage`)
  or code signing — this entry only closes the compile-check gap.
- Real app branding/icons still outstanding (Tauri's generated
  placeholders, per T4 step 1's entry).

**Next:** real branding/icons, or scaling the foundry pipeline up from
toy-corpus to a real small dataset with an actual LR schedule.

## 2026-07-22 — Core: url-sourced media blocks actually work now

A gap in the type system's own stated design, not a new feature: since
T0, `_MediaBlock.resolve_bytes()`'s docstring has said "url sources must
be fetched via `sarva.multimodal.fetch` (not implemented here)" — that
module never existed, so any `ImageBlock`/`AudioBlock`/etc. constructed
with a `url` source (as opposed to `data` or `path`) was unusable
end-to-end. Closed that gap.

**Built:**
- `core/sarva/multimodal/fetch.py` — `fetch_bytes(url)`: async, streams
  the response rather than trusting `Content-Length` (a misbehaving or
  malicious server can omit or lie about it), enforcing `max_bytes` from
  actual bytes counted while streaming, and restricts schemes to
  `http`/`https` (rejects `file://`, `ftp://`, etc. — this resolves URLs
  that arrive as declared media sources, so scheme hygiene matters even
  though there's no untrusted-user-input path to it yet). Accepts an
  optional `client: httpx.AsyncClient` so production call sites can share
  one client and tests can inject an `httpx.MockTransport` — no real
  network I/O anywhere in this entry's test suite.
  `resolve_media_bytes(block)` is the dispatcher: `data`/`path` sources
  resolve exactly as the existing sync `resolve_bytes()` already does,
  `url` sources go through `fetch_bytes`. Deliberately kept **out** of
  `content.py` itself — that module is the dependency-light type
  vocabulary every layer imports, and pulling `httpx` into it would
  couple the universal content model to a network library it has no
  other reason to need.
- Wired into `sarva.providers.anthropic_provider`: `_to_anthropic_message`
  is now `async def` and awaits `resolve_media_bytes` instead of calling
  the block's own `resolve_bytes()` directly, so an `ImageBlock` with a
  `url` source now actually reaches the Anthropic API instead of raising
  at request-build time. The one caller (`generate()`) already ran inside
  an async context, so this required no wrapper/anti-pattern — genuinely
  awaiting network I/O where the code was already async throughout.
- `tests/conformance/test_fetch.py` (7 tests) — response-body round-trip,
  scheme rejection, HTTP-error-status handling, the streamed size-cap
  (verified against a handler that doesn't even set `Content-Length`, so
  the cap can't be passing by accident via header-trusting), and all
  three `resolve_media_bytes` dispatch paths (data/path/url), all via
  `httpx.MockTransport` — no real network call anywhere in this suite.
- Updated `tests/conformance/test_anthropic_provider.py` for the new
  `async def` signature (its own docstring already called out that these
  tests use only in-memory `data` sources, so no I/O actually runs here
  either — the `await` exists because the function's shape changed, not
  because these particular tests exercise the network path).

**Known gaps:**
- No degrader implementations still ship (per the earlier codebase
  survey that identified this gap) — `fetch.py` makes url-sourced bytes
  loadable, it doesn't add image resizing/reformatting or audio
  transcription. That's the next natural piece if this area gets picked
  up again.
- `fetch_bytes` has no retry/backoff — a transient network blip surfaces
  as a `FetchError` immediately rather than retrying.

**Next:** a concrete image degrader (resize/reformat via Pillow for
provider context limits) to give the degradation registry its first real
converter, or continue elsewhere (branding, foundry scale-up).
