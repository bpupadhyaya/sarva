# Sarva — Build Journal

One entry per milestone: what was built, what was verified, what's next.

## 2026-07-21 — T0/T1: core engine scaffold

**Built:**
- Monorepo: uv workspace (`core/` = `sarva`, `foundry/` = `sarva_foundry`).
- `sarva.multimodal.content` — the typed multimodal block model (text, thinking,
  image, audio, video, document, tool call/result), frozen + discriminated union,
  with a degradation registry for cross-modality fallback.
- `sarva.providers` — the provider contract (`Provider` protocol, streaming
  `ProviderEvent`s, typed errors), the model registry + router (`models.yaml`
  / `routing.yaml`, data-driven), a deterministic `MockProvider` (offline,
  scriptable — drives the whole test suite with no API key), and a first
  Anthropic adapter (adaptive thinking, streaming, effort).
- `sarva.agent` — the agent loop (explicit state machine, budgets, concurrent
  tool dispatch, confirm-gated destructive tools, append-only JSONL transcript),
  built-in tools (read/write file, shell — sandboxed to the working directory).
- `sarva` CLI (`sarva chat`, `sarva run`, `sarva models`) — zero-config by
  default (falls back to the offline mock model with no API key set).
- 25 conformance tests across content/provider/agent — **all passing**.
- CI (GitHub Actions: lint + format check + test), ruff-clean, ruff-formatted.
- MkDocs skeleton (Part I, Chapter 1) and `examples/01_hello_model.py`.

**Real bugs found and fixed while building (not just theorized):**
- Pydantic's default JSON `bytes` serialization tries UTF-8 decode, which
  breaks on genuine binary image/audio data — fixed with
  `ser_json_bytes/val_json_bytes="base64"` on every content block.
- Rich's `console.print` interprets literal `[`/`]` in dynamic text as markup
  tags and silently drops unrecognized ones — fixed by escaping dynamic CLI
  output and disabling markup parsing for raw model text.

**Known T1 simplifications (documented in code, not hidden):**
- Multimodal degradation isn't wired into the agent loop yet — T1 tools are
  text-only, so this doesn't bite until T2's multimodal I/O pipeline lands.
- Concurrent tool-call events (`tool_started`/`tool_finished`) are yielded in
  two grouped passes rather than true wall-clock interleaving. Tools still
  *execute* concurrently; only event ordering is batched. Tightens in T3
  when a live-progress UI needs it.
- The Anthropic adapter is written to the documented SDK pattern but has
  **not been exercised against a live API key** in this environment — needs
  a real run to fully validate (its conformance tests are mock-only for now).
- `sarva run` with only the mock provider available never calls tools — the
  mock is a dumb echo with no reasoning, so tool-calling only shows up with
  a real model. Expected, not a bug.

**Next:** Ollama local adapter, live-key validation of the Anthropic adapter,
more built-in tools (web fetch/search), then T2 (multimodal I/O pipeline).
